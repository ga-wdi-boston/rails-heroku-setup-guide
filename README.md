# Rails Deployment with Heroku

You've learned a lot about how to build a Rails application over the last few
weeks. Now let's 'go public' and share our apps with the world!

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/rails-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/rails-activerecord-crud](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-activerecord-crud)
-   This guide assumes you have followed [these installation instructions](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template#installation) unequivocally.
## Objectives

-   Create a Heroku app from the command line
-   Push the latest code to Heroku
-   Migrate the production database

## Getting Set Up

Before you can begin deploying your applications to Heroku, there are some
things you'll need to do first.

1.  **Create a Heroku account**, at [https://www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).
    You will be sent an activation email, so be sure to check your inbox so that
    you can activate your account.
1.  Install the Heroku Command Line Tools: run `brew install heroku`.
1.  **Log into Heroku** by running `heroku login` from the console and providing
    your Heroku credentials when asked. Once you log in, if you're prompted
    to add these credentials to your keychain, say yes. *You will not be able*
    *to see your password*

## Deploying to Heroku

Now you're set up to use Heroku. To deploy a new application
to Heroku:

-   [ ] Run `heroku create` in the command line in the root of your Rails API to
    create a new (blank) app on Heroku.
-   [ ] Push your latest code to Heroku (`git push heroku master`)
-   [ ] Tell Heroku to run your migration files (`heroku run rake db:migrate`).
    If you have any other rake tasks that need to run (e.g. `rake db:seed`), run
    those with `heroku run` as well.

Let's look at each of these steps in detail.

### Create a New Heroku App

Go to the root of your repo and run `heroku create`. This will create an
_autogenerated_ name for your app, and add a new remote repository to your repo
 called _heroku_. View your remotes by typing `git remote -v`. You should see
something like:

```sh
    heroku  git@heroku.com:agile-badlands-7658.git (fetch)
    heroku  git@heroku.com:agile-badlands-7658.git (push)
    origin  git@github.com:tdyer/wdi_4_rails_hw_tdd_hacker_news.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:tdyer/wdi_4_rails_hw_tdd_hacker_news.git (push)
```

### Push `master` to Heroku

Only keep clean, working code on `master`. After you complete a feature merge it
onto `master`. Push your updated `master` to GitHub, then to Heroku.

```sh
git checkout master
git merge my-feature # merge your working code
git push # update GitHub
git push heroku master # udpate heroku
```

### Update Heroku's Database

Once you've deployed your code, you can safely run new migrations. You'll need
to do this step every time you have new migrations.

```sh
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

If you have seeds or examples, or if you've updated seeds or examples, you
should also run them on heroku.

```sh
heroku run rake db:seed
heroku run rake db:examples
```

### Check Your Work

Restart your application and check it out in the browser.

```sh
heroku restart
heroku open
```

You'll probably see something like this:

That's normal, **unless** you have defined a root route.

### Change Your App's Name (optional)

If you wish you can rename your app at any time. It must be unique across all
apps deployed to heroku.

```sh
heroku apps:rename newname
```

Your app will become immediately available at it's new subdomain,
`newname.herokuapp.com`.

## Heroku Command Reference

A full list of Heroku commands can be access by running `heroku --help`; below
are some of the more common ones.

## WARNING: Ephemeral Filesystem.

One serious limitation of Heroku is that it provides an 'ephemeral filesystem';
in other words, if you try to save a new file inside the repo (e.g. an uploaded
image file), it will disappear when your app is restarted or redeployed.

As an example, try running the following commands:

```sh
heroku run bash
touch happy.txt; echo 'is happy' > happy.txt
cat happy.txt
```

Then, hit Ctrl-D to get out of heroku bash shell. If you re-open the shell and
run `ls -l`, `happy.txt` will be missing!

The typical workaround is to save files in cloud storage such as [Amazon
S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/); more on this in the near future.

These are the commands required for deploying to heroku with rails. If your heroku deployment isn't working as expected, review these steps carefully. 
- `heroku create`
- `git push heroku master`
- `heroku run rake db:migrate`
- `heroku run rake db:seed`
- `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(rake secret)`
- `heroku config:set SECRET_TOKEN=$(rake secret)`
- `heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://yourgithubname.github.io`
- `heroku apps:rename newname` (optional)
- `heroku restart`
- `heroku open`
